<h2>Self Assessment</h2>
<h4>When I began the gaol was to learn how to code to improve the electronic things that I created. I realized early that if I didn't know how to code then anything that I built would just be a electronic paper work. The direction that the world is going programmable technology is everywhere. As the classes went along the world started focussing more on AI. The new goal was to learn about AI. Completing the different assignments taught me how to code in Python, C++, and JavaScript. The program also taught me about machine learning which is used in the project to figure out what products sale and which is likely to sale well, and which products are less likely to sale. From that there is the potential do create a program that selects the order that the product shows up when the user logs in. That would be more effective with a website with several different products. The class that I learned that taught it through creating a game. The game used machine learning that was reward based. If the move worked better for the machine, then there would be a point given. If the move resulted in a loss then there was a penalty and there would be a point lost. At the end of the game the machine would take the points that I got and use that to better move the next game. The system would run multiple games in order to figure out the best way to move. In another class I learned how to use MongoDB to create a database which I used to create a database for the Tyson foods that was being sold on the website.  </h4>
<h4>With my current career I have been able to focus on several skills. With my job as the plant engineer I have been able to lead multiple contractor companies in order to complete projects. When installing new equipment most of the time I have to use one company to install the electrical, one company to get the equipment in place and then one company that creates the equipment to help get the equipment up and running. </h4>
